## 1. Introduction

- **Purpose**
  - **Allowing one or more operations to be applied to a set of objects at runtime**
  - **Decoupling the operations from the object structure (= the set of objects)**
    > **<u>Info.</u>**
    >
    > It's important that the visitor pattern is used when the above two purposes are needed.
- **Use When**
  - An object structure must have many unrelated operations performed upon it
  - The object structure can't change but operations on it can
  - Operations must be performed on the concrete classes of an object structure
  - Operations should be able to operate on multiple object structures that implement the same interface sets

## 2. Characteristics

- Pros
  - **Makes adding new operations easy**
    - You can define a new operation simply by adding a new visitor
    - In contrast, if you spread functionality over many classes, then you must change each class to define a new operation
  - **Gathers related opertations and separates unrelated operations**
    - Related behavior is not spread over the classes defining the object structure; it’s localized in a visitor
    - Unrelated sets of behavior are partitioned in their own visitor classes
- Cons
  - **Adding new ConcreteElement classes is hard**
    - The Visitor pattern makes it hard to add new subclasses of Element
    - Each new ConcreteElement gives rise to a new abstract operation on Visitor and a corresponding implementation in every ConcreteVisitor class
  - **Breaking encapsulation**
    - Visitor’s approach assumes that the ConcreteElement interface is powerful enough to let visitors do their job
    - The pattern often forces you to provide public operations that access an element’s internal state, which may compromise its encapsulation
- Visitors can visit objects that don't have a common parent class.

## 3. Participants

- **Visitor**
  - declares a visit operation for each class of ConcreteElement in the object structure
- **ConcreteVisitor**
  - implements each operation declared by Visitor
- **Element**
  - **defines an Accept operation** that takes a visitor as an argument
- **ConcreteElement**
  - implements an Accept operation that takes a visitor as an argument
- **ObjectStructure**
  - can enumerate its elements
  - may provide a high-level interface to allow the visitor to visit its elements
  - may be a composite or a collection like a set or list

## 4. How to Use (Example)

- **Visitor**
  ```java
  public interface ICarElementVisitor {
      public void visit(Wheel wheel);
      public void visit(Engine engine);
      public void visit(Body body);
      public void visit(Car car);
  }
  ```
- **ConcreteVisitor**
  ```java
  public class CarElementPrintVisitor implements ICarElementVisitor {
      public void visit(Wheel wheel) {
          System.out.println("Visiting " + wheel.getName() + " wheel");
      }
      public void visit(Engine wheel) {
          System.out.println("Visiting engine");
      }
      public void visit(Body body) {
          System.out.println("Visiting body");
      }
      public void visit(Car car) {
          System.out.println("Visiting car");
      }
  }
  ```
  ```java
  public class CarElementDoVisitor implements ICarElementVisitor {
      public void visit(Wheel wheel) {
          System.out.println("Kicking my " + wheel.getName() + " wheel");
      }
      public void visit(Engine wheel) {
          System.out.println("Starting my engine");
      }
      public void visit(Body body) {
          System.out.println("Moving my body");
      }
      public void visit(Car car) {
          System.out.println("Starting my car");
      }
  }
  ```
- **Element**
  ```java
  public interface ICarElement {
      public void accept(ICarElementVisitor visitor);
  }
  ```
- **ConcreteElement**

  ```java
  public class Wheel implements ICarElement {
      private String name;

      public Wheel(String name) {
          this.name = name;
      }

      public String getName() {
          return this.name;
      }

      @Override
      public void accept(ICarElementVisitor visitor) {
          visitor.visit(this);
      }
  }
  ```

  ```java
  public class Engine implements ICarElement {
      @Override
      public void accept(ICarElementVisitor visitor) {
          visitor.visit(this);
      }
  }
  ```

  ```java
  public class Body implements ICarElement {
      @Override
      public void accept(ICarElementVisitor visitor) {
          visitor.visit(this);
      }
  }
  ```

  ```java
  public class Car implements ICarElement {
      private ICarElement[] elements;
      public Car() {
          this.elements = new ICarElement[] {
              new Wheel("front left"), new Wheel("front right"),
              new Wheel("back left") , new Wheel("back right"),
              new Body(), new Engine() };
      }
      public void accept(ICarElementVisitor visitor) {
          for(ICarElement elem : elements)
              elem.accept(visitor);
          visitor.visit(this);
      }
  }
  ```
